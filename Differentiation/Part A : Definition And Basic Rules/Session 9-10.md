## Outline

## General Derivative rules

### Product Rule

$(uv)' = u'v+uv'$ 

The way that you should remember this is by about changing one function at a time.

### Quotient Rule

$(\frac{u}{v})' = \frac {u'v - uv'}{v^2}(v \ne 0)$

## Chain Rule

The product rule tells us how to find the derivatives of a product of functions like $f(x) \times     g(x)$

The chain rule tells us how to find the derivative of a composition of functions like $f(g(x))$

For example, for the function $sin^{10}x$ , we can say $x = sinx$ and then $y = x^{10}$. Notice that if you plug $x = sint$ in the formula for $y$ , you get back to $y = sin^{10}t$ . Here use that intermediate variable $x$ is a big helo :

${\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} = {\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x} \times {\frac {\Delta x}{\Delta t}}}}$

## Higher Derivatives

Higher Derivatives are derivatives of derivatives.
