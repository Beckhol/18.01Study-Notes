# Notes to the Unit-1 Differentiation -> Part B: Implicit Differentiation And Inverse Functions.  
## [Session 13&14](https://github.com/Beckhol/CS-Notes-18.01-Single-Variable-Calculus/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20B:%20Implicit%20Differentiation%20And%20Inverse%20Functions/Session%2013-14.md)  
[Session 13: IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION] “Implicit Differentiation” is a way of applying the chain rule. Here it allows us to find a derivative we couldn’t calculate earlier.  
[Session 14: EXAMPLES OF IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION] Up to now, we’ve been finding derivatives of functions. Implicit differentiation allows us to determine the rate of change of values that aren’t expressed as functions.  
## [Session 15&16](https://github.com/Beckhol/CS-Notes-18.01-Single-Variable-Calculus/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20B:%20Implicit%20Differentiation%20And%20Inverse%20Functions/Session%2015-16.md)  
[Session 15: IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION AND INVERSE FUNCTIONS] An important application of implicit differentiation is to finding the derivatives of inverse functions. Here we find a formula for the derivative of an inverse, then apply it to get the derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions.  
[Session 16: THE DERIVATIVE OF A^X] We know how to take the derivative of a variable raised to a constant power. In this session we ask how to take the derivative of a constant raised to a variable power!
