# Notes to the Unit-1 Differentiation -> Part A : Definition And Basic Rules.  
## [Session 1&2](https://github.com/Beckhol/MIT18.01-Single-variable-calculus-Notes/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20A%20:%20Definition%20And%20Basic%20Rules/Session%201-2.md)  
[Session 1: Introduction to derivatives] provides a brief overview of Unit 1 and describes the derivative as the slope of a tangent line. It concludes by stating the main formula defining the derivative.    
[Session 2: Examples of derivatives] we apply the main formula for the derivative to the functions 1/x and x^n. We’ll also solve a problem using a derivative and give some alternate notations for writing derivatives.
## [Session 3&4](https://github.com/Beckhol/MIT18.01-Single-variable-calculus-Notes/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20A%20:%20Definition%20And%20Basic%20Rules/Session%203-4.md)
[Session 3: Derivatives as Rate of Change] We understand slope as the change in y coordinate divided by the change in x coordinate. Considering change in position over time or change in temperature over distance, we see that the derivative can also be interpreted as a rate of change. If we think of an inaccurate measurement as “changed” from the true value we can apply derivatives to determine the impact of errors on our calculations.  
[Session 4: Limits and Continuity] The main formula for the derivative involves a limit. This session discusses limits in more detail and introduces the related concept of continuity.
