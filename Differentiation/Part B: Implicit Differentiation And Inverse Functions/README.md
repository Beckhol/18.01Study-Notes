# Notes to the Unit-1 Differentiation -> Part B: Implicit Differentiation And Inverse Functions.  
## [Session 13&14](https://github.com/Beckhol/CS-Notes-18.01-Single-Variable-Calculus/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20B:%20Implicit%20Differentiation%20And%20Inverse%20Functions/Session%2013-14.md)  
[Session 13: IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION] “Implicit Differentiation” is a way of applying the chain rule. Here it allows us to find a derivative we couldn’t calculate earlier.  
[Session 14: EXAMPLES OF IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION] Up to now, we’ve been finding derivatives of functions. Implicit differentiation allows us to determine the rate of change of values that aren’t expressed as functions.  
## [Session 15&16](https://github.com/Beckhol/CS-Notes-18.01-Single-Variable-Calculus/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20B:%20Implicit%20Differentiation%20And%20Inverse%20Functions/Session%2015-16.md)  
[Session 15: IMPLICIT DIFFERENTIATION AND INVERSE FUNCTIONS] An important application of implicit differentiation is to finding the derivatives of inverse functions. Here we find a formula for the derivative of an inverse, then apply it to get the derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions.  
[Session 16: THE DERIVATIVE OF A^X] We know how to take the derivative of a variable raised to a constant power. In this session we ask how to take the derivative of a constant raised to a variable power!  
## [Session 17&18](https://github.com/Beckhol/CS-Notes-18.01-Single-Variable-Calculus/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20B:%20Implicit%20Differentiation%20And%20Inverse%20Functions/Session%2017-18.md)  
[Session 17: THE EXPONENTIAL FUNCTION, ITS DERIVATIVE, AND ITS INVERSE] In this session we define the exponential and natural log functions. We then use the chain rule and the exponential function to find the derivative of a^x.  
[Session 18: DERIVATIVES OF OTHER EXPONENTIAL FUNCTIONS] This session introduces the technique of logarithmic differentiation and uses it to find the derivative of a^x. Substituting different values for a yields formulas for the derivatives of several important functions. Further applications of logarithmic differentiation include verifying the formula for the derivative of x^r, where r is any real number.  
## [Session 19&20](https://github.com/Beckhol/CS-Notes-18.01-Single-Variable-Calculus/blob/main/Differentiation/Part%20B:%20Implicit%20Differentiation%20And%20Inverse%20Functions/Session%2019-20.md)  
[Session 19: AN INTERESTING LIMIT INVOLVING E] We’ve defined the function e^x and we know its derivative. What can we say about the number e?  
[Session 20: HYPERBOLIC TRIG FUNCTIONS] Hyperbolic trig functions are analogous to the trig functions like sine, cosine and tangent that we are already familiar with. They are used in mathematics, engineering and physics.
